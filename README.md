# MotorPH_Payroll_System

Overview

The MotorPH Employee Payroll System is a Java-based desktop application developed as an academic project to demonstrate the application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, file-based data persistence, and modular system design.

The system manages employee records, attendance-based payroll computation, and government-mandated deductions in compliance with Philippine regulations. All data is stored and processed using CSV files, with no database dependency.
